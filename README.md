## Abstract

Semantic image synthesis is one of the most common tasks regarding image-to-image translation. Generative Adversarial
Networks(GAN) models for semantic image synthesis gained more success, but it lacks structural and spatial information,
leading to unsatisfactory quality of the synthesized image and a significant gap between photo-realistic and synthesized
imagesâ€™ quality. In this paper, we propose a new generative adversarial network-based approach that can produce
high-resolution images from semantic label maps, reduce this gap, display better-detailed information for the generated
image, and produce better results. The proposed method first uses a local binary pattern convolutional generator,
which produces a local binary pattern feature map. Then, it obtains a global convolutional generator fed from the
segmentation map and the feature map via the learned modulation of a multi-feature adaptive denormalization layer
(MFADE) during the training process to generate a photo-realistic image. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed
method is verified using Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO-stuff datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate its
accuracy and strong robustness against the evaluation protocol used in semantic image synthesis tasks.
